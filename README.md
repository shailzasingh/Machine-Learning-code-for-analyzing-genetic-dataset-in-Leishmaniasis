# Machine-Learning-code-for-analyzing-genetic-dataset-in-Leishmaniasis

This code is meant for processing a genetic data of Leishmaniasis Cases in Human beings

The Datasets were collected from the Gene Express Omnibus database (A repository of functional genomes)

we Have collected 166 dataset comprising
    38 healthy persons dataset
