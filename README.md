# Machine-Learning-code-for-analyzing-genetic-dataset-in-Leishmaniasis

This code is meant for processing a genetic data of Leishmaniasis Cases in Human beings

The Datasets were collected from the Gene Express Omnibus database (A repository of functional genomes)

we Have collected 166 dataset comprising
    38 healthy persons dataset
    78 infected dataset
    10 lesion sample dataset
    40 Leishmaniasis patient dataset

The datasets were pooled into a sinsle .CSV file, with label encoded at the end of the data of all the samples
